## Requirements
**Python 3.9 or above** (older versions of 3.x will also work with the exception of one or two modules)

### Dependencies

Dependencies for your python environment are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using the below command. Ensure the `py` part is correct for your environment, eg `py`, `python`, or `python3`, etc. 

`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`  
or  
 `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

To run on **Linux**, you will also need to install `tkinter` separately like so:

`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

To install dependencies offline Troy Schnack has a neat process here:
